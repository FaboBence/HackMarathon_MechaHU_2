## Description

  Our project focuses on two important areas of hybrid office systems: how to allocate office resources and how to make hybrid working more efficient. üè¢

  As a result of the Covid home-office wave, more and more companies are likely to decide to reduce available offices spaces in order to save money, and only a part of the workers are going to work in the real offices, others are going to work from home. Making flexible weekly schedules is going to be more and more improtant, companies'll have to find a way to allocate office spaces to avoid crowding in the reduced offices spaces, but prevent unused office spaces which waste energy and money. Our machine intelliegence üß† solution provides an algorithm which creates a weekly schedules for the available office spaces. üìãüìã

  On the other hand, it's hard to make work efficient when some colleagues are present in the office, while others are at home. What's more, the main drawback of home offices is that you don't see what others are working on and you can't talk to your colleagues quickly, without having to organize meetings. We solve both of these problems with an innovative augmented reality office, where all workers can log in and show their progress and location. Whether you are at home or in the office, you can place your avatar in a room and update your status. If you want to talk to a colleague, you can check on the GUI where he/she currently is, an if he's/she's at home, you can simply place your avatar next to him to start videochat immediately, without having to schedule meetings.üëªüßë‚Äçüíº

  These two ideas, office allocation and AR-office are put together, so that companies can schedule their weeks, allocate space, track colleagues locations and current working status and videochat easily with the same programm, featuring machine intelligence and a comfortable GUI. üè¢

## Protoype

  During the weekend, all colleagues can register for office space for the next week. They have to type in on which day and in which time intervall they want to be present in the office, and with how many fellow colleagues they want to meet in the office. The office allocation algorithm creates a weekly schedule for the next week from the data of the registrations which prevents overcrowded rooms and ensures the meeting of people how want to work together. The algorithm creates many random schedule-plans, chooses the best of them via a predefined fitness function, and with fine local search, it finds the optimal one and transfers the schedule to the program.

  The program is a server-client communication based graphical user interface, which works as an augmneted reality office with online and real office rooms. If a colleague logs in, he'/she's avatar is placed into the room in which he should be according to the schedule, or he/she is put into the online spaces if he/she is working from home. You can see all your logged-in colleagues locations. For example, if someone working from home wants to ask a quick question from a fellow colleague, he/she simply has to grab his avatar and place it into the rooms in which the other one is working. Then, the program starts a videchat immediately between the two person, making communication easy even in hybrid offices. Or, if you want to check whether there are free rooms available, you can simply have a look at the augmented reality ofiice GUI to fnd free spaces.

## How to try

*List any URLs relevant to demonstrating your prototype, e.g. a live url where judges can preview your app. Note that judges won't be able to setup anything in their computers.*

## Presentation

*List any links to your presentation or additional materials that you want to share with the judges.*

## Challenges and accomplishments

During both parts of our project we learned a lot new things and gained further experiment in programming:
- While creating the office allocation algortihm, we got to know many interesting algortihm-possibilities and modern methods to implement machine intelligence to a certain problem.
- The creation of the server-client communication was a real challenge, now we understand the way of working of such systems much better. Creating the GUI was also a brand new experience to the group, this was the first time we created a graphical user interface to our program.

## Next steps
Our idea is quite complex, hence there are lot's of further features which are waiting to be implemented:
- We would like to make space registraion easier via an online questionaire  (in the current status of the program, you have to type in your space request into a .csv file)
- We would like to further develop the office space allocation algorithm to make it find the optimal schedule quickly, even for bigger, more comlicated office systems. 
- The augmented reality office has many more development-possibilities: working status, file sharing, advanced avatars holding more information, rooms with different roles, etc.
- We would like to make server communication faster and more stable with advanced programs
- The GUI could be developed by creating interactive items in it, and the graphics can be developed, too.
